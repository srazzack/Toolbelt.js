<h1>Toolbelt.js</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a JavaScript utility-belt library offering support similar to prototype.js; a duplication of Underscore.js implemented with my own source code. Since the Toolbelt.js functions and Underscore.js functions share the same output; please refer to the documentation on http://underscorejs.org/
